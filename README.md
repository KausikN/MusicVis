# Piano Sequencer
- Load MIDI Files
- Edit piano notes as JSON or using Simple Note Code (described in the app)
- Generate audio from the piano notes
- Visualise MIDI plot of the notes and other visualisations

# Piano Music Generator
- Generate randomised and parameterised piano tracks using basic notes, chords and other tracks
- Generate audio from the generated piano notes
- Visualise MIDI plot of the notes and other visualisations

# Visualisations
## MIDI Plot
- Piano notes visualised as a horizontal bar chart
    - X axis is time
    - Y axis contains the unique notes

## Circle Bouncer
- In a circle where the notes are dispersed uniformly on its perimeter, note sequence is visualised as a video
    - Moving from one note to another triggers a change in the internal part of the circle
    - For "line_sequence" mode, a single line is drawn from the previous note to the current note and the drawn lines persist

    ***(Oppenheimer : Can you hear the music?)***
    - For "converge_sequence" mode, a line is drawn from all previous notes to the current note and the drawn lines are cleared at each iteration
